# Just the Frontend of the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org)

To include a Go snippet in your blog or site, then you'd normally use the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org) like so:

```html
<iframe src="https://play.golang.org/p/HmnNoBf0p1z"></iframe>
```

However, you can't change the way it looks, because you can't edit the CSS of an iframe.

This repository provides the files from Playground so that you can style them to your liking, but they are slightly modified to keep using Playground as a backend. 

Note that the Go Playground has some conditions: 

>The playground service is used by more than just the official Go project (Go by Example is one other instance) and we are happy for you to use it on your own site. All we ask is that you contact us first (note this is a public mailing list), use a unique user agent in your requests (so we can identify you), and that your service is of benefit to the Go community.
